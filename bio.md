<h2>Daniel Baker</h2>
<p>At a young age I became involved with Christian Service Brigade, completing all the achievement levels including the Herald of Christ award. As a young adult I served on the staff of their camp in New York, <a href="http://www.northernfrontier.org/">Northern Frontier</a>.</p>

<p>I graduated from Wheaton College in 1977 – BS Biology and Wheaton Graduate School in 1982 – MA Interdisciplinary Studies. In between college and graduate school, I attended Eastern Mennonite College for three terms.</p>

<p>After Wheaton, I went on to pastor three churches scattered across the states in: northern New York, southern Texas, and West Virginia. The first two were with the Christian and Missionary Alliance and the third was with the Church of the Brethren.</p>

<p>In mid 2005, an old college injury officially disabled me. The chronic pain from the injury made the next several years very difficult. Since 2012 I have been  making slow progress, thanks to limiting the more drastic medications, a working spinal cord stimulator, physical therapy, and a lot of work. While still unable to be a full time pastor, I have been able to pick up writing again which I am sharing on this website.</p>

<p>I am married with 4 children, 2 grandchildren, and 1 step grandson and currently reside in South Carolina.</p>
