Joy is something that we crave and need in our lives, yet it is not something that many people associate with faith and especially not with religion. Admittedly, religion too often drives out joy with its lists of rules, emphasis on everything you are doing wrong and playing up your guilt all of which build fear not joy. This is terrible for many reasons, among them are the great damage physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually done to so many. Another is that this negative emphasis goes directly against the teachings of Jesus.

Jesus wants us to have a life full of joy; he tells us that:

“I came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.” John 10:10  

“These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and that your joy may be made full.” John 15:11  

 “Until now you have asked for nothing in My name; ask and you will receive, so that your joy may be made full.” John 16:24  

 “… these things I speak in the world so that they may have My joy made full in themselves.” John 17:13  

My hope and intention is that the posts in this blog will help lift up your spirit, encourage you and that you might find that joyful life Jesus wants you to have.
