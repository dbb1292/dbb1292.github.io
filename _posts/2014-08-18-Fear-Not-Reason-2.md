Everyday life has situations that can prompt anxiety, if you look back over a few days you could probably tell me about some. That makes anxiety a common emotion. Anxiety by itself is bad enough, but for many it can get debilitating. A few days ago I heard about a young woman who experienced such anxiety that it turned into “panic attacks” severe enough that she quit her job. 

It is reassuring that God takes our anxiety seriously and addresses it in these 4 reasons why we should not be fearful or anxious. Look with me at the second reason.

Reason #2 – “Do not anxiously look about you, for I am your God. Isaiah 41:10b

This reason tells us that God is not only present, he is a personal God.  

It can be frustrating to be asking for help and finding out the person you look to for help just does not care. There are times when we feel God is like this, so this verse is especially important. Isaiah 41 and the Bible as a whole make a point that God cares about you.

Psalm 23 is loved for many reasons one of them is that it is so personal. “The LORD is my shepherd, shall not want.” Psalm 23:1 The whole Psalm continues in that personal manner. Some people like to substitute their name in place of the pronouns as an exercise to see just how personal it is. You can do the same thing with Isaiah 41:10,

			Do not fear, for I am with _____,
			Do not anxiously look about _____, for I am _____’s God.
			I will strengthen _____, surely I will help _____,
			Surely I will uphold _____ with My righteous right hand.

Not only is God personal but he actually chose us. Isaiah makes that point in 41:8-9, 

“But you, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, Descendant of Abraham My friend,  You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, And called from its remotest parts And said to you, ‘You are My servant, I have chosen you and not rejected you.’” (emphasis added)

You could think that all this was just meant for the Jewish people of Isaiah’s day, except for comments like this one by Paul in Ephesians 1:4-5,

“just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,” (emphasis added)

This choosing by God tells us that God is not just interested in us like a duty sort of thing. God is interested in me because he has chosen to, he specially chose each one of us, and is our personal God because he wants to be. Reflect on that and it can mean a lot!

What this all comes down to is each one of us can take all the anxiety that life can stir up in us and put this verse into action,

casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.   1 Peter 5:7

Lyrics: FEAR NOT:  Phil Pringle
	Fear not,  I have redeemed you,
	For I am with you.  I have called you by name.
	Fear not,  Child, you are Mine.
	For I am with you.  When you walk through the waters,
	Fear not,  I will be there
	For I am with you.  And through the flame.
	Says the Lord.  You'll not  (no way)
		Be drowned!
		You'll not  (no way)
		Be burned!	
		For I am with you.
