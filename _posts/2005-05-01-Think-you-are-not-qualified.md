When people get turned down for jobs, loans, and programs they applied for one common reason given is: "you just are not qualified?"  In so much of today's world what is important is do you have the right degrees or certifications. As a result, if you do not have them you can have trouble even being noticed. Worse, you can start feeling as if you are worthless and dumb.

What if God approached you like that? You applied to Him for forgiveness and he rejects you. What if God said back, "Sorry, but your sacrifice was not big enough" or "Sorry, but you did not say it right?" If that happened, where would you be? Well, you would be in a lot of trouble!

Fortunately, God is not like that. He is incredibly gracious, takes us where we are and then gives us "on the job training" to get us moving toward the goal of being like Jesus. As He tells us,
> "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. ... My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense-Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world." {1 John 1:9-2:2}

I find it incredible and encouraging that we have a God who will take care of our sins, forgive us, and purify us like this. As I read the Bible, I also find it almost unbelievable whom He chooses for important tasks. Take the task of spokesman for the early Jerusalem Church. This is a very sensitive role. You have to be able to think quickly and respond politely. A well-rounded education so you can speak in a cultured and smooth way is essential. Also having the ability to "beat around the bush" when asked questions definitely is a plus.

So, who does God have fill that role, Simon Peter! First off, Peter is not educated and he never pretends to be. While Peter is willing to talk and say what is on his mind, he is usually not the most smooth, sensitive, cultured, polite speaker you could think of. And I do not know that he ever "beat around the bush." Yet in the first part of Acts, he is the spokesman for the Church and for God!

So why did God choose Peter? While Peter did not have most of the qualities we would think necessary for the job, he did have ones God thought were important. Peter was totally sold out to God. There is no doubt about his devotion to God.

Peter also was faithful. Over the course of his whole life, faithfulness to God stands out. This trait of faithfulness is one that God values and commands. "Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life." {Revelation 2:10b}

I think a reason God choose Peter for this role was because he had these traits. They may not be ones that we would look at first off but then, "The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart." {1 Samuel 16:7b}

This difference in viewpoint often makes little sense to us. Why would God forgive like this? Why would God call people like this to such roles? It all seems so unnatural! Just maybe that is part of the point God is making. Our way of seeing the world and thinking about things might be natural, but by God's standards is often wrong. Therefore, we have to get our viewpoint in line with His.

This difference also encourages me. Many of us feel hammered and of little worth due to the messages we receive from the world around us. These come from school, other people, work, the media, etc. God looks at us differently. He does not look at our education, wealth, status, or who our relatives are. He looks at our heart, our character, faithfulness and desire to serve him. No matter how this world views you, you can serve God in whatever way He calls you!

Remember God will accept you, love you, and have you work for him. So choose to go to God, seek how He wants you to serve, and know that he accepts you.
