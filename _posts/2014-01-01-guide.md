First Level Header
==================

Second Level Header
-------------------

This is just a regular paragraph. You can just type it normally.

### Header 3

#### Header 4 (more #'s you add the smaller the header gets)

> This is a blockquote
> 
> Here is a second paragraph inside the blockquote
>
> ## This is an H2 (second level header) inside a blockquote

> This is another blockquote
>
> > This is a blockquote inside the other one!
>
> Back to the outer blockquote

You can add *emphasis* by using asterisks. You can also _emphasize_ by using underscores. This will look like italicized text.

If you want to add some **strong** emphasis you can use asterisks or __double__ underscores. Text inside double asterisks or underscores will appear bold.

Lists are easy, you can use *, +, or -. For instance:

* Fir
* Birch
* Elm

or

+ Maple
+ Hickory
+ Oak

or even

- Cedar
- Pine
- Walnut

To make an ordered list just use numbers followed by a period:

1. Milk
2. Butter
3. Bread

If you want a muptiple paragraph list item, you can indent the second paragraph with a tab or 4 spaces to put it inside the list item.

* A list item.

    With multiple paraphaphs.

* This is the second list item.


If you want a link to something use [ ] and ( ). For instance [Google](http://www.google.com). You can also through in a title attribute inside the parans. [Bing](http://www.bing.com "This would appear as a tooltip").

If you'd rather have the links listed somewhere else (for readibility), you can reference them with [ ] and a footnote-like syntax. [Yahoo][1].

[1]: http://www.yahoo.com "This is a tooltip for Yahoo"

You can also use text inside the footnote identifiers: [Facebook][facebook].

[facebook]: http://www.facebook.com

To include images use the exclamation point in front of the [ ]. For example: ![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "optional title"). You can also use the reference style like links.
